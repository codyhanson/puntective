\section{Future Work}

An interesting and valuable addition could be the rendering of the Pun Graph into an interactive image, where nodes and edges could be visualized, explored, and modified. The Graph could be output to a JSON format, which could be suitable for consumption by a graphing library such as D3 \cite{D3}.

Another interesting technique could be to automatically transcribe vocalized words into text, and do real time analysis on the fly. This may or may not be feasible depending on processing latency and number of heuristics being applied.
