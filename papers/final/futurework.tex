\section{Future Work}
As can be seen by the inconclusive results of the simple heuristics that were implemented, additional and more complex heuristics will be required to be implemented to 
Another interesting technique could be to automatically transcribe vocalized words into text, and do real time analysis on the fly. This may or may not be feasible depending on processing latency and number of heuristics being applied.

Finally, a `training database' of previously constructed pun graphs and their resulting scores could be useful in an advanced learning algorithm. By storing many samples of already processed humor, including confidence scores and relationships encoded in the Pun Graph, a learning agent could draw upon this data to more accurately predict if a new piece of text is humorous, and which other jokes and puns it is similar to.
