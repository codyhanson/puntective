\section{Conclusion}

This research topic took on a difficult problem, teaching computers about humor. While the problem may not have been solved by this attempt alone, the authors believe that using a graph topology to encode humor information has potential to be taken forward by future work. We also were able to show that there is some threshold of analysis that must be crossed in order to make these sophisticated classifications, and a few simple heuristics were not enough to be able to distinguish a pun from a non-pun. Due to the open source nature of the work I have done, other researchers will be able to pick up where I have left off.
