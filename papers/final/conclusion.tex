\section{Conclusion}

This research topic takes on a difficult problem, teaching computers about humor. Due to the limited time available for the work, the authors will strive to make meaningful progress for a manageable subset of the problem.  This includes not exhaustively searching for breakthrough heuristics, but instead focusing on building a framework that can be easily leveraged by other researchers.
