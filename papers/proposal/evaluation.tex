\section{Evaluation}

In order to judge the effectiveness of the system, we will compare the results of the pun classification to that of a human expert. We will build a dataset that contains a mixture of text snippets that contain puns, and some that do not. Also, because not all puns are created equal, we will seek out puns of varying complexity to attempt to highlight limitations of our techniques. To ensure that the evaluation is fair, the texts in the dataset will be selected with as much randomness as possible, from a pool of candidates.
